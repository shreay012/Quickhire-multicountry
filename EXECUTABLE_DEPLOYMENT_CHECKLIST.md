## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING DURING PHASES

### Phase 1: Collecting Credentials
**Problem**: Can't find MongoDB URI
**Solution**: Go to MongoDB Atlas → Click cluster → Connect button → Look for "Drivers" option

**Problem**: Can't find Redis URL
**Solution**: Go to Upstash → Click database → Copy "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL"

### Phase 2: Filling Form
**Problem**: Environment variable field won't accept my value
**Solution**: Make sure you're clicking in the correct field. Try clicking "Add Environment Variable" again.

**Problem**: Can't find the form fields
**Solution**: The form is on the Render website. Make sure you're logged in to Render.

### Phase 3: Waiting for Deployment
**Problem**: Service stuck at "Building..."
**Solution**: Check Render logs. Common issue: Missing environment variables. Go back and add them.

**Problem**: Service shows error
**Solution**: Click service → View logs → Look for error message → Check which env var is missing

### Phase 4: Getting SERVICE_ID
**Problem**: Can't find the URL with SERVICE_ID
**Solution**: Go to Render dashboard → Services → Click your service → Look at URL bar

### Phase 5: Final Deployment
**Problem**: Workflows not starting
**Solution**: Wait a few seconds after git push. Then refresh GitHub Actions page.

**Problem**: Frontend workflow fails
**Solution**: Vercel tokens might be wrong. Check that VERCEL_TOKEN is correct.

**Problem**: Backend workflow fails
**Solution**: Check that RENDER_SERVICE_ID is correct (should start with srv_)

### Phase 6: Verification
**Problem**: Frontend loads but shows errors
**Solution**: Open browser console (F12) → Look for error messages → Check if backend is running

**Problem**: Can't log in
**Solution**: Check database connection in Render logs. Make sure MONGO_URI is correct.
